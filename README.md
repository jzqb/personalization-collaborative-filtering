# Music Recommendation - Hybrid Recommender System using Factorization Machines, Content Based Recommenders and SVD++ [Part II]
In this project, we aim to predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the user’s very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise.   
Our dataset come from a Kaggle competition, where KKBOX provides a training data set consisting of information of the first observable listening event for each unique user-song pair within a specific time duration. Metadata of each unique user and song pair is also provided.

# Collabortive Filter: Recommending Jokes [Part I]
Recommender Systems are indispensable tools today to provide personalized user experience. In this project, we build and evaluate memory based and model based recommender systems for jokes. We will be using the recommenderlab package in R. However, we will also demonstrate brute force coding approach to collaborative filtering.

## Why recommend jokes?
* Jokes can be used to as an affiliate to get traffic on a website. Everybody likes good humor and it might be a good idea to recommend “funny” jokes to the right people to generate more clicks on an online property which drives revenue.
* The general idea of jokes (humor) can be extended to more profitable domains, like recommending books based on synposis/summary, music based on lyrics and movies based on summaries.
