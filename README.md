## Why recommend jokes?
* Jokes can be used to as an affiliate to get traffic on a website. Everybody likes good humor and it might be a good idea to recommend “funny” jokes to the right people to generate more clicks on an online property which drives revenue.
* The general idea of jokes (humor) can be extended to more profitable domains, like recommending books based on synposis/summary, music based on lyrics and movies based on summaries.
